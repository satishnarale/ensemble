Description: This package has two techniques of ensemble learning implemented 
  namely, Bagging and Stacking.
  Stacking******* function takes 1) dataset, 2) Split ratio, 3) Response variable as arguments 
  It uses SVM, Decision tree and Logistic Regression as base learners for stacking 
  For meta model training it uses Random Forest 
  This function returns confusion matrix 
  Note:- please not that response variable should have factor levels or else SVM will not work 
  Bagging******** function takes 1) dataset, 2) Split ratio,3) Number of samples on which models to be train, 4) Response variable as arguments, 5) Numbers of trees to train 
  It functions takes out samples from the dataset provided as per the Learner number passed in the argument  
  Each sample will be train using Random Forest with number of trees passed in argument 
  This function returns Average Accuracy.
